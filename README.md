### Introduction

What is this trying to accomplish? What is the value?
link to Cube

### Support
We've intended to build the subset of functionality that we need into the Cube client presented.  We recognize that not all of the functionality available to the Javascript client has been ported, but we plan to expand feature support as find it necessary.  Contributions are always welcome; see [Contributing](#contributing).

### Example

    - [ ] how to instantiate a client
    - [ ] how to make a query
    - [ ] how to use the results

    take example from Pendrick test
    mention that you have to have Cube running locally
